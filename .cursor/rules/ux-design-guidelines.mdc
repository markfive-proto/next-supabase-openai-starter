# UX & Design Guidelines

## Design System
- Use Shadcn/ui components as foundation
- Maintain consistent spacing with Tailwind's spacing scale
- Follow modern, minimal design principles
- Prioritize visual hierarchy and readability

## Color Usage
- Use generated moodboard colors as accent colors in the UI
- Maintain high contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Use neutral grays for interface elements
- Implement proper dark/light mode support

## Typography
- Use system fonts for interface text
- Display generated font pairings prominently in moodboard preview
- Maintain consistent type scale across components
- Ensure readable font sizes (minimum 14px for body text)

## Layout & Spacing
- Follow 8px grid system for consistent spacing
- Use white space effectively to avoid clutter
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44px for mobile

## User Experience Patterns

### Loading States
- Show skeleton loaders during AI generation
- Display progress indicators for long operations (5+ seconds)
- Provide estimated time remaining for moodboard generation
- Use subtle animations to indicate processing

### Error Handling
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Provide clear recovery actions ("Try Again", "Use Different Prompt")
- Display fallback sample moodboards when generation fails
- Implement graceful degradation for API failures

### Form Design
- Keep the main prompt input prominent and focused
- Use placeholder text to guide users: "e.g., Minimal AI dashboard for doctors"
- Provide example prompts for inspiration
- Auto-focus and auto-resize text input

### Moodboard Display
- Use card-based layouts for clean organization
- Display color swatches with hex codes visible on hover
- Show images in a grid with consistent aspect ratios
- Make font names clickable to preview in Google Fonts

## Accessibility
- Implement proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the app
- Add alt text for all generated images
- Test with screen readers
- Support high contrast mode

## Performance UX
- Show immediate feedback when user submits prompt
- Use optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Implement image lazy loading for better performance
- Cache and preload common resources

## Mobile Experience
- Design touch-friendly interface elements
- Optimize moodboard display for smaller screens
- Ensure prompt input is comfortable on mobile keyboards
- Test on various device sizes and orientations

## Conversion Optimization
- Make the main CTA ("Start With a Vibe") prominent on homepage
- Reduce friction in the generation process
- Show examples of successful moodboards for inspiration
- Implement smart defaults to speed up user flow

## Brand Personality
- Friendly and approachable tone in copy
- Use creative terminology ("vibe", "mood", "aesthetic")
- Incorporate subtle animations and micro-interactions
